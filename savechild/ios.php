Forty seven child labour victims depose in front of a jury

Diminutive and weak legged 13-year-old Alagumuthu started crying as she narrated how difficult it is after travelling almost four hours to reach the spot and work under freezing conditions at a sea food processing unit where she has to stand the whole day with no protective gear and sort prawns and crabs meant for export.

This sixth standard dropout had no other way but to work under hazardous conditions for a paltry Rs.110 the whole day to support her family after her father abandoned them following her mother’s death. She and her elder sister, who is also working in a unit in Tuticorin district, work hard to make their younger brother study and also support their ailing grandmother.

Such heart wrenching stories formed the public hearing on child labour held at Ramanathapuram on Saturday.

Forty seven among the 365 child labour victims deposed in front of a jury on reasons for dropping out from school and factors that pushed them to child labour.

The Rural Workers Development Society (RWDS), a non-governmental organisation, along with Child Relief and You, who studied 90 villages in Kadaladi, Tiruppullani and Mandapam coastal areas in the last five years with an emphasis on socio-economic development, have identified 365 child workers. Inaccessibility to schools due to lack of adequate transport was the major reason for incidence of child labour among communities engaged in palmyra work.

More voices of children

M. Kalanjiyam of Gandhi Nagar in Mariyoor was studying in Class XI when she had to discontinue her studies to support her family as there was a loss of livelihood in her father’s palm-related work. The girl, who had scored 410/500 in Class X examinations, had to migrate to Coimbatore to work in a spinning mill.

A. Adilakshmi of Kannigapuri in Kadaladi had to discontinue her studies and work at a spinning mill. It was even worse as she had to leave the spinning mill after an accident and now works in a salt pan at Vepoladai in Tuticorin district.

R. Jayalakshmi of seventh standard from East Allikulam and Vijayalakshmi of Manikka Nagar too complained about the lack of educational facilities in their respective villages and difficulty in travelling to schools. They asserted that multiplicity of economic woes forced some of their friends to quit schooling and support their families by working at salt pans and helping their parents in palm-related works.

S. Sathiah, Director, RWDS, said that the itinerant nature of work of palmyra climbers gave them no other choice but to take their children along. This mobility factor results in their children's education becoming a casualty.
