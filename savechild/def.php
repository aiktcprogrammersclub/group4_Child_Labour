&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term child labour, is best defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development. It refers to work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children, or work whose schedule interferes with their ability to attend regular school, or work that affects in any manner their ability to focus during school or experience a healthy childhood.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNICEF defines child labour differently. A child, is involved in child labour activities if between 5 to 11 years of age, he or she did at least one hour of economic activity or at least 28 hours of domestic work in a week, and in case of children between 12 to 14 years of age, he or she did at least 14 hours of economic activity or at least 42 hours of economic activity and domestic work per week.UNICEF in another report suggests, "Childrens work needs to be seen as happening along a continuum, with destructive or exploitative work at one end and beneficial work - promoting or enhancing childrens development without interfering with their schooling, recreation and rest - at the other. And between these two poles are vast areas of work that need not negatively affect a childs development."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;India's Census 2001 office defines child labor as participation of a child less than 17 years of age in any economically productive activity with or without compensation, wages or profit. Such participation could be physical or mental or both. This work includes part-time help or unpaid work on the farm, family enterprise or in any other economic activity such as cultivation and milk production for sale or domestic consumption. Indian government classifies child laborers into two groups: Main workers are those who work 6 months or more per year. And marginal child workers are those who work at any time during the year but less than 6 months in a year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some child rights activists argue that child labour must include every child who is not in school because he or she is a hidden child worker.UNICEF, however, points out that India faces major shortages of schools, classrooms and teachers particularly in rural areas where 90 percent of child labour problem is observed. About 1 in 5 primary schools have just one teacher to teach students across all grades.
