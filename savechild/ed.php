<h3>What is the current state of education in India in comparison to other developing countries?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>India state of education lacks effectiveness in yielding basic literacy in the population. It has been observed that 
"the overall condition of the education system can be a powerful influence on the supply of child labour" (Grootaert and Kanbur 1995, 193).</li>

<li>The 1991 Census of India shows that 64% of males and 39% of females are literate (The World Bank 1995, 113) -- an increase of 17% and 14%
 respectively from the 1981 census (Census of India 1981 cited in Weiner 1991, 11).</li>
 <li>These increases seem significant, but India’s overall literacy rate of40.8% lags behind other developing countries such as 
 China (72.6%), Sri Lanka (86.1%), and Indonesia (74.1%), all of which have Per Capita Incomescomparable to India has (Weiner 1991, 161).</li>
<li>India has primary-school survival rate of 38.0% is also lower than China has rate of 70.0% and Sri Lanka has rate
 of 90.8% (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization cited in Weiner 1991, 159).</li>
 <li>This indicates that few students are reaching 
 fifth or sixth grade, and dropout rates support this conclusion.</li>
<li> Dropout rates measured by the Department of Education show that 35% of males and 39% 
 of females dropout (Government of India cited in The World Bank 1995, 113). What is the reason for these high dropout rates and poor school survival rates? 
 One possible argument given by Nangia (1987) is that "the pressing need for the child has earnings as well as low perceived advantages of school" cause
 parents to withdraw children from school and deposit them in the labour force (p.182). In this case, poverty and the inadequacy of the school system play
 significant roles in causing child labour, but also affect each other. Poverty forces high dropout rates, and thus no matter how good schools are, 
 school survival rates and literacy rates will still remain low.
Compulsory Education.</li>
<li>The concept of compulsory education, where all school aged children are required to attend school, combats the force of poverty that</li>

<h4>Education System</h4>
<p>The constitution of India guarantees to all children Right to Education. But this group of children is completely left out and do not fall
 into wets of education. The fundamental Right of Education Covers the age group of 6 – 14 years where as convention to Rights of Children ensures
 the education of children from 6 – 18 years. Here we can see the gap in the age factor. Also there is provision made for the child to continue education 
 after the age of 14 – 18 years. Other major factors that contribute to the failure of universalisation of education are:</p><br>
