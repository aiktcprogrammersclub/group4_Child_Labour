<h2>Cause Of Child Labour In India</h2>
<img src="img\c10.png" height="300" width="850">	
<p>The causes are quite similar to any other country, though with many Indian singularities. Everyone agrees that child labor is a plague but most families know they do not have much choice: not putting a child to work means there won not be enough food on the table for everyone.
Schools also tend to teach things that arenot always very useful to kids once they get back home, let alone to find a low-skilled job. In that sense, they donot provide much justification for parents to give their kids an education if they donot see immediate benefits. There is not as much as culture of education as you can find in East Asian countries for example and thats because schools have never really been a means of social ascension. The caste system completely prevented that for centuries.</p>
<p>
But things are slowly changing as the government is trying to improve the quality of schools as well as making their program more practical and relevant to childrens lives. Another problem remains: parents are not making enough of a living to sustain their family. Thats plain and simple poverty causing and fueling child labor in India. Be it in manufacturing or in agriculture, people are systematically under-paid.
</p>
<p>
Although child soldiers and child workers in the sex industry have higher profile in the media, most kids are in fact involved in farming and factory work. Both also include very serious health damages (e.g. hazardous smokes and pesticides). Putting your kids health at risk in order to survive is not a choice any parent should have to make in his or her life.
</p>
<h3>Thus Basic Cause Of Child Labour Are</h3>
<ul>
<li>Poverty</li>
<li>Parental illiteracy</li>
<li>Tradition of making children learn the family skills</li>
<li>Absence of universal compulsory Primary education</li>
<li>Social apathy and tolerance of child labour</li>
<li>Ignorance of the parents about the adverse consequences of Child labour</li>
<li>Ineffective enforcement of the legal provisions pertaining to child labour</li>
<li>Non-availability of and non-accessibility to schools </li> 
<li>Irrelevant and non-attractive school curriculum </li> 
<li>Employers prefer children as they constitute cheap labour and they are not able to organize themselves  against  exploitation.</li> 
</ul>
<h4>Where do they work ?</h4>
<p>Although India has never sent as many kids to school as today, the official goal of achieving universal primary education is far from completed. While factories, sweatshops and their luxury working conditions often get more media coverage, the bulk of child labor in India happens in the fields. 
However this does not make it less hazardous: kids are more sensitive to dangerous insect and animal bites, but also to pesticides and accidents (tools, machinery) which happen nearly as often as in the manufacturing sector.
</p>
<p>
In general, laws and government bans against child labor only have a very limited impact and in some cases they aggravate the situation, causing poor families to end up poorer. In India, it also reveals the lack of workers rights but also problems law enforcement. Aside the economics of child labor, there are also sociocultural problems: caste, class, discrimination and cultural biases (e.g. against girls).
The reason child labour in India is so hard to fight is also that most of it is informal, often occurs within the boundary of the family, and is therefore very hard to track down. And when it comes to legal sanctions, taking action against the parents is probably the worst thing to do for these kids. Whatever you do, they are likely to end up worse off than they were before.

If poverty conditions the childhood of many Indians, there are also unexpected consequences that arise when governments get very zealous at promoting education. For instance, many parents make many sacrifices to be able to send their kids to school when they really can not afford which ends up putting everyones health at risk (both the kids and the parents).
In some cases, children working full-time have better chances of making it to adulthood than those who work less (or not at all), simply because they’re better fed. This shows the perverted effects of poverty on child labour and education and how these problems are interwoven. Parents who receive some welfare assistance are often happy to send their kids to school, but because of the limited social support they receive (not enough to feed their kids properly at least), this choice may end up harming their childrens physical development in the long run.

<h3>All-out war on child labour in India</h3>
<p>
As always there is no silver bullet against child labour, let alone poverty. What works is a broad strategy aimed at reducing poverty, investing in human labour and infrastructures (local schools, quality , education). Economic opportunities to increase household income are key. Yet, even in this case there are problems specific to India. 
We have often argued that proper land re-distribution (which has never been accomplished by the government) - to break with the quasi-feudal landlord system – would not only be fair to exploited farmers and families, it would also dramatically increase their revenue. 
But you can already see a new dilemma: in the first years of receiving more land, parents would want to make the most of it and would most likely hire their own kids to help. Its normal considering that itd take a while before they can afford to hire staff or buy machines. But in that process they deny their kids their right to education and what we consider a normal childhood (playing, having fun, learning).
It would also make education less appealing since parents can already guarantee a job to the next generation by bequeathing the land to their kids. You can see how the issue of child labour would become much more complex and its a problem that already exists in many developed countries as well.
Many argue rightfully that what matters is the childrens rights and freedom to choose how they want to lead their own lives. However the reality is much different and often times we are all caught in traditions and family pressure. Breaking free sometimes also means breaking up with your family or taking the risk to create deep tensions and misunderstandings. It's the classic tale of family responsibilities vs. freedom.
