New Delhi, August 28, 2012: In a significant move to curb the rampant spread of child labour across the country, the Government of India is set to<br>
 ban the all forms of child labour under the age of 14 years, making the employment of children below 14 years a criminal offense. The Union cabinet of <br>
 India approved the Child & Adolescent Labour (Prohibition) Act today putting a blanket ban on employing anybody below 18 years in hazardous occupation.<br>
 Such hazardous occupations have also been re-classified in line with the increase in the minimum age of child labour from 14 to 18 years.

However, it will allow employing children only between 14-18 years in non-hazardous industries like forest gathering, child care etc.<br>
 Children between 14-18 years have been defined as "adolescents" in the amended Act. Employing a child below 14 years in any kind of occupation is<br>
 set to become a cognizable offence, punishable with a maximum three years imprisonment or fine up to a maximum of Rs. 50,000 (~US$ 900)
